<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CV Axle Joint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outboard Joints</li><li>Inboard Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CV axle joint market comprises two main types: outboard joints and inboard joints. Outboard joints are located near the wheel hub, handling steering and suspension movements while transmitting power to the wheels. They are exposed to higher stress due to constant angular changes. Inboard joints, positioned near the transmission, primarily accommodate length changes in the axle during suspension travel. Both joints are critical for smooth power transfer and vehicle performance, with outboard joints focusing on steering dynamics and inboard joints on suspension flexibility.</p></p>
