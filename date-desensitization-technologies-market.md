<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Date Desensitization Technologies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic Masking</li><li>Static Masking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Date Desensitization Technologies encompass methods to protect sensitive data while preserving its usability. Dynamic Masking alters data in real-time during access, ensuring that users see only masked information without changing the original dataset. This is ideal for environments requiring ongoing data processing while maintaining privacy. Static Masking, on the other hand, creates a permanent copy of data that is anonymized and cannot be reversed. This approach is used for secure data storage and testing purposes, ensuring compliance and reducing risk.</p></p>
