<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Autoclave Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>SFPP</li><li>Pre-Vac</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horizontal autoclave market features three main types: Gravity Displacement, Steam Flush Pressure Pulse (SFPP), and Pre-Vacuum systems. Gravity autoclaves rely on steam rising to displace air, ensuring effective sterilization. SFPP combines steam flushing with pressure pulses to enhance penetration and reduce cycle times, making it efficient for complex instruments. Pre-Vac systems remove air before steam introduction, allowing for thorough sterilization of dense loads. Each type serves specific sterilization needs in healthcare and laboratory settings.</p></p>
