<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Split Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The split mechanical seals market is categorized into two primary types: pusher type seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals feature an elastomer bellows that continually exerts pressure to maintain contact with the rotating shaft, ensuring effective sealing even under varying conditions. In contrast, non-pusher seals rely on a fixed seal arrangement and do not have a moving component to adjust for wear, making them simpler but potentially less adaptable. Both types are essential for various industrial applications, particularly where maintenance and replacement are crucial.</p></p>
